  title: "Finding a Great Startup Idea if You're a Young Founder",
  content: `
    <p>My first startup idea was a photo taking app for license plates to flag illegally parked cars. That was an okay startup idea. The main problem was that it involved fighting against a slow system- the Indian government. I spent over 8 years thinking and doing initial versions of many startup ideas until I found one that worked. The one that worked got me pre-seed funding and into Y Combinator at the age of 22. Here's what I've learned about finding a very good startup idea.</p>

    <h3>1. A startup is built around a problem</h3>

    <p>It's a simple statement that many, including me, have ignored. I think the iPhone and Facebook's success inspired a generation of founders to chase cool solutions instead of problems. After all, those are very appealing products. But a good startup idea solves an incredibly pressing problem and doesn't start as a solution.</p>

    <p>What defines an incredibly pressing problem? Willingness to pay to have it solved.</p>

    <p>Y Combinator likes to use the analogy of a "hair on fire" problem, a problem so bad that your customer's hair is literally on fire. They would probably pay you a lot of money if you give them a fire extinguisher.</p>

    <p>That is the foundation of a very good startup idea. So when you're thinking of a startup idea, keep asking yourself everyday - is this a very pressing problem?</p>

    <h3>2. How to find a problem</h3>

    <p>Problems are important for finding good startup ideas. But how do you find a good problem to solve? Many say that the best place to start is you. I think the best place to start is you if you have experience in the workforce. After all, most corporate work is filled with problems. However, I was given this advice as a college student. The only problems I faced were in school and social situations. This advice didn't quite apply to me. So how did I find a good startup idea? I looked at startups that popular early stage accelerators like Y Combinator, Neo, South Park Commons and others funded. This was beneficial because these accelerators usually accepted founders with work experience. These founders were closer to a lot more problems, and the startups that got funded were indicative of the pressing problems. After all, a startup only gets funded if it makes money, and it makes money because it is solving a pressing problem.</p>

    <p>When I was doing this exercise I started noticing patterns. Typically these companies would be selling to businesses, not consumers. Why? Because the most pressing problems arise because someone needs to make more money or save money. These two functions are core to any business. If a business is failing in any of these regards, it's a very big problem and they will probably pay a lot for you to solve it.</p>

    <p>Consumer ideas can be good but they are harder to find. Why? Because consumers usually don't have a high willingness to pay. The reason enterprise companies get funded more is because they make more money. Enterprises have bigger bank accounts. For new founders, doing an enterprise startup idea is easier.</p>

    <h3>3. Choosing the right enterprise idea</h3>

    <p>For new founders, doing enterprise is like getting into a black box. It is foreign. The next step is to become an expert. Going through companies that are recently funded will expose you to new problem spaces. For example, you may see that there are a lot of companies getting funded in the voice agent space for customer support. Why? Because call centers involve manual work and present huge cost savings if automated. But you probably know nothing about customer service. There are two ways to solve this problem:</p>

    <p><strong>1. Talk to COOs (Chief Operating Officers)</strong></p>

    <p>COOs probably decide if their company needs a call center automation or not. They are decision makers and are the most valuable person to approach.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Ask ChatGPT</strong></p>

    <p>AI has made everything learnable. Use AI to reflect on your conversations with COOs and identify pain points. Use AI to understand the broader headwinds that affect the problem space. Who are your competitors, why are they winning and why are they losing.</p>

    <p>Getting in touch with COOs is not easy. Personal connections are the best starting point but it's unlikely that many of us would know a COO. Luckily there are many outreach automation tools that exist. These outreach tools can automate outreach to LinkedIn profiles and emails. You can get these LinkedIn profiles and emails from a lead generation tool like Clay. You can then create an email or LinkedIn sequence to reach out to hundreds of chief operating officers. Tools that can do this include Instantly, Hey Reach, and Growth Machine. Get on calls with them and hear about their problems. That is a treasure chest of its own. Having these conversations would reveal a lot of problems that COOs face, and it's important to distinguish between the ones that are pressing and the ones that are not. You can use the pattern of customer service automations to strike an initial conversation.</p>

    <p>Next, talk to ChatGPT. This is a tool that no generation has ever had access too and it turns out that it knows a lot about different problem spaces. Use ChatGPT to learn about the space, the challenges that other companies have had, and any other details.</p>

    <p>Using these two approaches will help you align on the right enterprise idea. The example of Voice AI for customer support can extend to many other problem spaces.</p>

    <h3>4. Evaluating multiple problem spaces to pick one</h3>

    <p>These conversations will likely yield a lot of interesting problem spaces. Choosing one is a challenge. In order to answer this question, we can work backwards from what a successful startup looks like. A successful startup is a unicorn - a $1B valuation. This usually requires an ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) of $100M. The hardest way to get to $100M in revenue is by selling your product for $1 to 100M people. The easiest way to get to $100M in revenue is by selling your product to one enterprise for $100M. Obviously these are two extremities and are practically impossible. But it is worth being closer to the latter than the former. A general rule of thumb would be to charge at least $100,000 and sell to 1,000 enterprises. That is a lot of money, and your startup idea should be solving a problem that can warrant a sum like that. The best way to see if your idea is worth that much is to ask your customer. Taking the example of a COO, I would pitch a demo/pilot and charge them an annual fee of $100,000. If they agree, it is probably a very good startup idea.</p>

    <p>A common exception to this is the agency model. An agency sells its services for money, not a SaaS product. The downside of charging for human services is that it is not scalable. You could probably charge $100,000 for your first 100 customers but it is near impossible to do that for the next 900 because you're selling time, not technology. Agencies could be great cash flow positive businesses, but they often do not reach $100M in revenue. This is totally fine, it is just not venture scale and does not offer generational wealth.</p>

    <p>This model is another argument against consumer startup ideas. With a low willingness to pay, founders need to rely heavily on network effects to reach a lot of people. There are great success stories of this like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. That being said, network effects are much harder to create because they rely on other people to spread the word for you and people are unreliable.</p>

    <p>Why was my first startup idea not a good startup idea? It turns out the government didn't really care about taking illegally parked cars off the road. A problem to you may not be a problem to the decision maker, and it is important that you validate it with them first. And getting money from the government?</p>

    <p>These are the exact steps I took to land on the problem I'm solving today. These learnings are a mix of my personal experience and guidance from Y Combinator. Find a pressing problem, validate it with your customer, and charge them a lot of money. That is the path to finding a great startup idea.</p>
